# THE HOLES THOSE DELETIONS JUST MADE ARE THE PROBLEM, AND THE BIGGEST OF THEM
# IS THE OLD COPY OF THE IMAGE ITSELF.
#
# macOS's FAT driver allocates from the first free cluster, so a hole near the
# front of the volume is where the next write goes. Clearing the metadata above
# leaves a scatter of small ones; deleting the previous image leaves eighteen
# clusters' worth in exactly the shape the previous image had.
#
# THE ORDER HERE IS THE WHOLE FIX. An earlier version wrote the filler first
# and deleted the old image afterwards, inside the copy loop -- so the filler
# covered the metadata holes, the delete then opened up the old image's
# clusters, and the copy dropped straight back into them. Fragmented exactly as
# before, every time, on a card that is 99.8% free. It appeared to work once,
# on a card that had never held the image.
#
# So: delete everything we are about to write FIRST, then fill what that left,
# then copy into the clean space beyond it, then take the filler away. The
# image is placed by then and does not move.
#
# HOW THIS WAS ESTABLISHED, because it took three bad guesses first: read the
# card's own FAT with tools/fatchain.py. A real card showed
#
#     ZIPEDIT-REL.po   clusters 8227..8244
#     ZIPFILER.po      clusters 8248..8249     <- a two-cluster hole
#     APPLESIDE.po     clusters 8250..8267
#     ZIPFILER.po      clusters 8268..8283
#
# -- the new copy had gone straight back into the shape the old one left. That
# is the whole mechanism, and it is self-perpetuating: once an image is
# fragmented, deleting it reopens exactly those clusters and the next copy
# takes them again. It never recovers on its own, which is why it happened
# every single time rather than now and then.
#
# THE FILLER ALSO HAS TO BE BIG ENOUGH. At 32MB it covered 4096 clusters and
# reached fifteen clusters past the fragmentation on that card -- true by luck
# rather than by design. 128MB is four times the distance the damage ran.
